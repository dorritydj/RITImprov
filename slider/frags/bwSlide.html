			Austin Scott loves the art of improv. He got his start practicing long form with a group that never revealed itself to the public, Flog the Land Mutton. Since then, he has been a part of several different troupes and shows, some at RIT and others elsewhere in Rochester. In addition to performing, Austin actively participates in producing improv shows and teaching RIT Improv's workshops. As President of RIT Improv, Austin also does a lot of the behind-the-scenes planning that makes RITI tick. Austin Scott - coming soon to a marquee near you! (Or hopefully a local newspaper or something)</p>

			Currently resides as a salesmen at the Scranton branch of Dunder-Mifflin in beautiful Scranton, PA. Plays guitar, acts with a script, and basically anything else that doesn't involve improvisation. He's pretty cool. This bio can say that because this bio isn't being written by Joe.</p>

			Nick Rabb is a tried and true improviser. Serving as part of the improv troupe Downstage at Fairport High School for three years, he practiced and mastered the art of short form comedy. After his ascension into collegiate status, Nick decided that he would try to look into Brainwreck as per his friend Kurt's "recommendation". After Brainwreck awakened his passion for long form, Nick decided to also look into improv around the city of Rochester. Outside of his improv life, Nick is a passionate student of computational sciences and hyper-text intranet design.

			He also loves dogs.</p>
