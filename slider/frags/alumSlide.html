			<p>Hometown:Pittsburgh, PA<br />
			(Improvessionals 2010-2012)<br />
			One of the founders of the Improvessionals, and resident art-slave of RIT Improv. Lacks the ability to curl his tongue, but in exchange gained the ability to destroy his enemies with digressions into typographic theory and you-shouldn't-have-used-those-colors-there-you-fool-ology. Enjoys cooking and making comics too slowly. May secretly be a squirrel.</p>

			(BrainWreck Improv, 2011-2012)<br />
			Allie is a lover of romantic comedies, dancing wildly in the streets, and frolicking in fields of daisies. When she's not IMPROV-ing, you can most likely find her taking silly pictures, doing that whole "scripted acting" thing, embracing her inner nerd, and on the rarest of occasions, in class.</p>
