			Coordinator of extracurricular special events for the Improvessionals
			Miranda Gehris has more medical problems than you have nucleotide base pairs in your genome.  In her lifetime she has tripped over a pig, castrated a goat, and laughed so hard that she dislocated a rib.  She is a genetics genius and can beat you at limbo any day of the week.  Yes, that is a Challenge.</p>
