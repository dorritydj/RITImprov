Christopher Baum
Hometown: Pittsburgh, PA<br/>
(Improvessionals 2010-2012)<br/><br/>
One of the founders of the Improvessionals, and resident art-slave of RIT Improv. Lacks the ability to curl his tongue, but in exchange gained the ability to destroy his enemies with digressions into typographic theory and you-shouldn't-have-used-those-colors-there-you-fool-ology. Enjoys cooking and making comics too slowly. May secretly be a squirrel.
