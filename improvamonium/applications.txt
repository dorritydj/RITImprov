Left For Dead Improv|Bio: The members of Left For Dead, a Rochester, NY improv comedy team, have walked this planet for almost half a millennium. Its seven baby-boomer performers are writers, scientists, bankers, artists, craftspeople and technicians. They’ve experienced marriage, divorce, broken bones, depression, migraines, heart attacks, the loss of loved ones as well as parenthood, grandparenthood and even great grandparenthood. Their travels have taken them across the Americas, Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Brooklyn. They have lived through success and failure, heartache and joy. Since 2011, they’ve expressed the meaning of their exceedingly long lives through comedy–improv, sketch and standup. 

Left for Dead performs at assisted living centers and theatre spaces around Rochester. They have also participated in the Providence Improv Festival, The Rochester Fallback Festival, Syracuse Thumbs Upstate Festival, RIT's Improvamonium and Pittsburgh Comedy Festival. 

Their coach is the amazing, youthful and ever-patient Megan Mack.|7|Roger Dube|dube@cis.rit.edu|College|no|yes|https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/v/t1.0-9/536092_175256939277878_1546688888_n.jpg?oh=ae63df4a0dc1d0a63d4fde5ec1cf2a3d&oe=55857B33&__gda__=1434836325_bcea2ee8f3a653aa318dab2622e13f40|
