Born in 1994, Colleen was not a mistake. Throughout her life, Colleen was 
rejected by natural society. After a harsh upbringing of Cartoon 
Network, Neopets, and Toontown, she then became a cosplayer. Colleen 
graduated high school at the ripe age of 17 when her mom began grooming 
her to be a typical white girl. Colleen then decided she liked shopping 
and bought a lot of clothes, makeup, and Pokemon games. Today you can 
find Colleen eating cake or desperate for street passes.
