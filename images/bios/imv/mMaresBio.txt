Matt Mares
(Improvessionals 2014 - Present)<br/><br/>
Matt Mares (call me Mares) is a 5th year Mech Eng going for one of those Masters.  Joined The Improvessionals in the Fall of 2013, rocked the Treasurer position of his Fraternity, Pi Kappa Phi for the 2014 year and continues to be awesome in his free time by playing songs on his trusty guitar.  Fun fact: the only food's I've encountered so far that I've deemed uneatable are Grapefruits and Olives; everything else is ok.<br/><br/>
