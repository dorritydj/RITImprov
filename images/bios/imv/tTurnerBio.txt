Hometown: Gilbertsville, PA<br/>
(The Improvessionals 2014 - Present, RIT Improv Secretary 2015 - Present)<br/><br/>
Timmy Turner was born in 1996, and is a fairly odd character that no one truly understands. He used to be just an average kid. Now you can find him at his computer watching random shows such as Yu-Gi-Oh GX, collecting things that are past their prime (Bakugans) or making boxes for the future. He strives to not break 'Da Rules' and to get along through. In the near future Tim's entire wardrobe will consist of Fallout 3/New Vegas shirts and sweatshirts, and his walls covered with video game art.
