Conor McKaig
(Work In Progress 2014 - Present)<br/><br/>
Conor joined RITI in 2014 when he joined [Work In Progress], new to improvising Conor draws from his
past stage experience often. A self-proclaimed natural performer Conor had his humble beginnings in 
open mic nights, singing and regurgitating stand-up comedy. Upon arriving at RIT he satiated his love for 
performance by joining RIT Players (All Shook Up, Urinetown) in 2013, shortly before joining RITI. Conor 
also enjoys sports.
