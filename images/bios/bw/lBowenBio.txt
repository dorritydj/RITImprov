Leslie Bowen
(BrainWreck Improv 2012 - 2014)<br/><br/>
Leslie is on Brainwreck which is pretty cool. In her spare time she can be found pretending to exercise while gorging herself on Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. She has now been doing improv for 2 years thanks to peer pressure and a passion for the stage. Leslie has also performed as part of 'Fembot', 'Left Brain, Right Brain', 'Ctrl Alt Improv', and in several shows for the RIT Players. That's it, I'm done with this bio now.
