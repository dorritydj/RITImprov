Elijah Crocker
Hometown: Rochester, NY<br/>
(BrainWreck Improv 2013 - Present)<br/><br/>
Elijah comes from a background of theatre, music, and general tomfoolery.<br/><br/>
If there's one thing that Elijah wants you to know, it's that his greatest accomplishment is his act of properly cradling the improv balls.
