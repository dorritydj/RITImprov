Allie Trimboli
Hometown: Las Vegas, NV<br/>
(BrainWreck Improv, 2011-2012)<br/><br/>
Allie is a lover of romantic comedies, dancing wildly in the streets, and frolicking in fields of daisies. When she's not IMPROV-ing, you can most likely find her taking silly pictures, doing that whole "scripted acting" thing, embracing her inner nerd, and on the rarest of occasions, in class.
