Austin Scott loves the art of improv. He got his start practicing long form with a group that never revealed itself to the public, Flog the Land Mutton. Since then, he has been a part of several different troupes and shows, some at RIT and others elsewhere in Rochester. In addition to performing, Austin actively participates in producing improv shows and teaching RIT Improv's workshops. As President of RIT Improv, Austin also does a lot of the behind-the-scenes planning that makes RITI tick. Austin Scott - coming soon to a marquee near you!
