Miranda Gehris
(Improvessionals 2012 - Present)<br/><br/>
Coordinator of extracurricular special events for the Improvessionals Miranda Gehris has more medical problems than you have nucleotide base pairs in your genome. In her lifetime she has tripped over a pig, castrated a goat, and laughed so hard that she dislocated a rib. She is a genetics genius and can beat you at limbo any day of the week. Yes, that is a Challenge.
